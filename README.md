## Requirements:

- The website should be responsive and built with ReactJS functional 
components and Typescript
- Data should be downloaded asynchronously 
- Changing the number of elements in the json file should change the 
number of elements on the page
- The code should be placed in any repository along with instructions 
on how to run the project.
- [Nice to have] Unit test



### Next.js 

I used API routes provide as a solution to build own API with Next.js.
Any file inside the folder pages/api is mapped to /api/\*.

## MUI

I used Material UI.
Material-UI is simply a library that allows you to import and use different components to create a user interface in our React applications.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
https://github.com/CarolinaFledgling/task-chooosen.git
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

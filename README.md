# TASK CHOOOSEN

Task from Company Chooose

I used API routes provide as a solution to build own API with Next.js.
Any file inside the folder pages/api is mapped to /api/\*.

Check the link to the [Link ](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)

I used Material UI.
Material-UI is simply a library that allows you to import and use different components to create a user interface in our React applications.
